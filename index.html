  <p> Since the Covid-19 crisis outbreak in Europe in early March, Taiwan has been praised as its proactive and quickly response to the pandemic and hasn’t seen any local transmission in weeks.This also increase the visibility of Taiwan in the news coverage.  </p>
  <p> Therefore, I am interest in how Taiwan been covered in the past 10 years. I choose New York Times as my target news outlet as using the archive API to do the article research. </p>
  <p>The following content includes text analysis and mining through R.</p>

  <h4>Frequency of post mention Taiwan</h4>
  <div class="paragraph">
    <p>By scraping the post in past 20 years, the result reveals that New York Times publish seven articles related to Taiwan on 23 March 2008,
      which was the day after its presidential election. NY Times also mentioned Taiwan six times at the day President George W. Bush
     visiting China and said the United States strongly opposed Taiwan's independent Referendum.</p>

      <p>Taking a look of the coverage in 10 December 2003, it is clear that it was related to China, which was the main focus of New York Times reporting Taiwan's story.</p>
      <p>As Taiwan usually links to China’s issue due to the politics and democracy status, I also add several searching queries to compare the difference.</p>
      <p>As the result reveals, though China had far more coverage than Taiwan, it also shows a similar trend of dropping since 2010.</p>
